    "The dataset contains $N = 1960$ measurements of energy consumption for different implementations and functionality of a web application. For each setup, there are 20 measurements. The dataset is in the file [dataset.csv](dataset.csv). The variables in the dataset are:\n",

For instance, `rust-actix` denotes the web framework Actix for the programming language Rust, or `c-sharp-razor` denotes the web framework Razor for the programming language C#.\n",
